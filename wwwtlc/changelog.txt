Loan Processing should work now. The workflow should be something like:
Basic/Standard Application -> 
'Submit a Loan' -> 
Loan Payments (accounting) -> 
Loan Payments (blockchain)

Also, a note on the 'Submit a Loan' form. It will create a NewLoan object. This is going to be the new model for the old loan.models.Loan. It contains mostly the same data, except for some fields that have been relocated to the LoanTerms model. All the notes on the differences between the two will be documented under the loan-vs-newloan.txt file. All of the indented fields are the NewLoan equivalent of the old Loan fields

There has been a lot of model restructuring in wwwtlc, to lighten up the inital load of finding things, I'll leave a map here:

models_loan_apply.py:
	ContactRequest
	PropertyInfoRequest
	CurrentMortgage
	MortgageDesired
	BorrowerInfoRequest
	NewRequestSummary
	
models_bse.py: (bse = basic, standard, extended)
	BusinessInfo
	ConstructionInfo
	PropertyInfo
	BorrowerInfo
	CreditRequest
	ApplicationSummary
	Declaration
	AcknowledgeAgree
	EmploymentIncome
	BankAccount
	AssetSummary
	ManagedProperty
	
models_meta.py: (unsure if this is an accurate name
	#NO SQL
	Contract
	Credit_Report
	Bank
	Bank_Account
	Borrower
	Partner
	# Structured Data

	Verified

7.4.18 - Alex - second commit

The navigation/form session issue seems resolved. I had to change the way that the form navigation interacted with the forms. Now, however, you can navigate freely through each step and access information that you've already submitted. The only caveat currently is that you must hit the 'submit' button on every step for it to save the session information for that form.

So, due to the issues yesterday pointing me at using the NamedUrlWizardView of the formtools app, I decided to implement that feature instead of using the basic formtools WizardView. This is going to allow us to target specific steps via url and manipulate the data or store the session information. Currently, the code is mostly working. It hits the database, and saves all of the form data at the end. The features that will need implemented are as follows:
	- Free navigation to any form previously completed
		: Currently, the navigation has a bug that won't allow you to access a form ahead of the
		: one that you're currently on. An example of this would be if you are currently on form 8
		: and jump back to form 5, you will not be able to access any form via navigation from
		: form 6 upwards, it also will delete any data that you entered on those steps.
		:
		: The fix for this will probably end up being saving the state of that form in a session,
		: and then pulling that session information anytime that the form is called, and if the
		: form has no session data, then just display the empty form

Currently, the 'save-every-step' and 'form navigation' features have been implemented, however they do come with significant bugs. Currently the code is in a psuedo-functional state. Everything is just partially completed, thorough testing needs to be done as well as bugfixes. The current issues/brainstormed solutions are below.

The current bugs for the tiered/multi-step forms are:
	- The navigation buttons submit data to db
		: Unsure of how to fix this, it seems to be an issue with how the forms are called
		: The get_form() method is called everytime a 'submit' type button is posted
		: Using the get_form() method seems to be really bad code, so that may be dropped
		: altogether, but a substitute is not obvious
		
	- When moving to a previous step, it deletes session data for next step, even if submitted
		: This may be easy to figure out when moving from the get_form() method to call
		: the forms.
		: Currently, it seems as though the formtools 'NamedWizardView' should be applied,
		: that way the instance data can be prepopulated, as well as potentially fixing the 
		: navigation issues. This method would need a lot of restructuring in the views.py,
		: urls.py, and templates. Still needs further research
		
	- Some forms do not allow done() method to redirect to pages/loan_apply_done.html
		: This is a confusing problem, there is no obvious answer. Very unsure how to 
		: approach this one. However, it may become more clear/sort itself out after solving
		: other issues in this list
		
	- The done() method saves form data to db, even though it's already being submitted each step
		: The potential fixes for this would be to form.save(commit=False) every form in the
		: form_list, or to ditch the get_form() method altogether, abandoning that method
		: of saving every step.
