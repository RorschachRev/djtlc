5.4.18 - Alex

Form was modified to accomodate styling. Models were also created to allow for database usage in Loans app. Files that I changed today:
    -home.html
    -loan_apply.html
    -forms.py
    -views.py
    -wwwtlc/urls.py - minor fix to work with loan_apply.html
    -models.py
    -admin.py - created an admin interface to input data into Loan app

5.3.18 - Alex

Form was modified so that input fields show up on loan_apply.html. Other files were changed as well to accomodate this, such as:

    -urls.py - the previous url pointed at a different view then the one I was
                 working on, I left the original url commented out in case we
                 need to change back to it
    -forms.py
    -loan/views.py
    -loan_apply.html

5.2.18 - Alex

Form was written with django 2.0 doc, needs to be converted into 1.11v style forms
Files that will need to be modified to accomodate this (within the app 'loan'):
	views.py
	forms.py
	loan_apply.html
	(possibly)
	home.html
	login.html
	urls.py

Additional files that were changed:
    header.html - commented out most of navigation for readability (nav was overlapping content I was working on)

I sent the django 1.11 documentation over discord
