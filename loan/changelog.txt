5.2.18 - Alex

Form was written with django 2.0 doc, needs to be converted into 1.11v style forms
Files that will need to be modified to accomodate this (within the app 'loan'):
	views.py
	forms.py
	loan_apply.html
	(possibly)
	home.html
	login.html
	urls.py

Additional files that were changed:
    header.html - commented out most of navigation for readability (nav was overlapping content I was working on)

I sent the django 1.11 documentation over discord
