5.9.18 - Alex
Tasks Completed:
    Added OneToMany(ForeignKey) field to Loan_Data/TLC_balance, as well as reverse lookup
    Added help_text and verbose_name attributes throughout models to improve user-readability
    Modified Loan/forms.py to reflect changes in models, and to add things user should enter
    Recreated the DB so that it allowed nullable fields in modified models

Problems Encountered:
    Same problems as 5.8.18, but fixed with the help of Ian

5.8.18 - Alex
Tasks Completed: 
    Created 'alias' for the admin view of Addresses - changed __str__(self) to output self.street1 to display that instead of 'Address object'
    Added choices list for Borrower model in Loan_Data to include different types of entities
    Added hint/help text for Person.phone
    Added nullable fields to Address.street2/street3, Person/name_middle

Problems encountered:
    Could not add any nullable fields within the Verified model
    Could not enter data into Person, or any model referencing Credit_Report, Bank, or Bank_Account; Also couldn't allow null=True on these fields in order to test functionality due to them being ForeignKeys

5.4.18 - Alex

Form was modified to accomodate styling. Models were also created to allow for database usage in Loans app. Files that I changed today:
    -home.html
    -loan_apply.html
    -forms.py
    -views.py
    -wwwtlc/urls.py - minor fix to work with loan_apply.html
    -models.py
    -admin.py - created an admin interface to input data into Loan app

5.3.18 - Alex

Form was modified so that input fields show up on loan_apply.html. Other files were changed as well to accomodate this, such as:

    -urls.py - the previous url pointed at a different view then the one I was
                 working on, I left the original url commented out in case we
                 need to change back to it
    -forms.py
    -loan/views.py
    -loan_apply.html

5.2.18 - Alex

Form was written with django 2.0 doc, needs to be converted into 1.11v style forms
Files that will need to be modified to accomodate this (within the app 'loan'):
	views.py
	forms.py
	loan_apply.html
	(possibly)
	home.html
	login.html
	urls.py

Additional files that were changed:
    header.html - commented out most of navigation for readability (nav was overlapping content I was working on)

I sent the django 1.11 documentation over discord
